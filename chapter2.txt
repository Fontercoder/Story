It was the age of technology, it was the age of Space.
This was the first time when we show a blue power beam , that scattered the astoried shower.
When we lost our hope it comes like a boon and give his hands to us to live again , to explore again and 
the most importance a chance to meet them , The alians. That time we realised that we are not alone in this galaxy.
There are some eyes on us which were continuously  monitoring us , trying to understand us , observe us.
