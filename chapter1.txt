It was the best of space. It was the worst of space.
When our spacecraft met that asteriod shower which contains 
the humangous astoriod 'AMPHERIA'.
'The Atoka' our spaceship, got  stuck in the middle of that unstopable merciless attack of Asteroids.
Our sheild of spaceship had proofed itself useless just within 20 min. 
The heartbeat of all onboarders and passengers was going higher every second.
Water drops were started giving it glance on the face of Rohan , the captain of spaceship.
It was the  hardest and terrifying memories of our life.
But that wiz kid , a man of just 25 years saved us our life with his right decision at the moment.
He instantly took all the controls of Atoka, give insturctions to the officials to take necessory steps.
And when he sit on the pilot seat his insane piloting skill saves us next 5 hours without having our
protecting sheild. It was going well untill saw AMPHERIA which had come in path of Atoka.
